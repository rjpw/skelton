That means that the garbage collector is free to reclaim that memory, which means that the logger configuration is lost. For example,\nconsider:\n</p> <pre>public static void initLogging() throws Exception { Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(\"edu.umd.cs\"); logger.addHandler(new FileHandler()); // call to change logger configuration logger.setUseParentHandlers(false); // another call to change logger configuration\n}</pre> <p>The logger reference is lost at the end of the method (it doesn't\nescape the method), so if you have a garbage collection cycle just\nafter the call to initLogging, the logger configuration is lost\n(because Logger only keeps weak references).</p> <pre>public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception { initLogging(); // adds a file handler to the logger System.gc(); // logger configuration lost Logger.getLogger(\"edu.umd.cs\").info(\"Some message\"); // this isn't logged to the file as expected\n}</pre>\n<p><em>Ulf Ochsenfahrt and Eric Fellheimer</em></p>"
